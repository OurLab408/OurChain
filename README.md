# OurChain

## What is OurChain?

OurChain is a fork of Bitcoin Core that aims to provide a more efficient and autonomous blockchain. The main changes include, but are not limited to:

## Features

- GPoW (General Proof-of-Work) algorithm: a new PoW algorithm that is more efficient than the original PoW algorithm.
- OurContract: a new smart contract system that is based on the Bitcoin architecture.

## Quick Start

After starting the OurChain node, you can use the `bash mytest.sh` command to try basic contract rpc commands.
